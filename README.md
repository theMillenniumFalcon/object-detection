The application intends to let anyone share their screen with one or more number of people.  
The application comlpletely respects your privacy and ensures that none of the data will ever be sniffed/saved by me.  
It also guarantees minimum latency as the connection is peer-to-peer rather than usual peer-to-server-to-peer.  


## NOTE: The application uses webRTC for peer to peer connection and thus some browser might not be supported well and can become a bottle neck
